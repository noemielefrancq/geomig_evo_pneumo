## sensitivity analyses

# '_carriageLocs'
# samples only 2/9 provinces - only those with carriage data as Mpumalanga and Gauteng have. 

# 'wrongGenTime' 
# fit as if we have estimated a 2X greater generation time than there truly is.

# 'wrongGenTime05'
# fit as if we have estimated a 0.5X generation time than there truly is.

# 'randomSamp'
# fit as if we have randomly downsampled the dataset irrelevant to whether samples are from each province or not. 

# 'randomSamp2' 
# fit as if we have taken a biased downsample including an equal number from each province.
